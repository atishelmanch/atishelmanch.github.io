[ATLAS](https://atlas.cern/) and [CMS](https://cms.cern/collaboration) are both very cool physics collaborations, whose detectors are based at the [CERN](https://www.home.cern/) [LHC](https://www.home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider). Their organizations are structurally similar, leading to groups and positions which have similar roles but somewhat different names. The purpose of the table below is to translate the same type of group/position between the two collaborations. <br> <br>

| Description | ATLAS | CMS | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| The group facilitating a certain physics topic| PA group | PAG | 
| Physics Coordination (cognate) | PC | PC |
| The group responsible for software modelling of physics processes. | PMG (Physics Modeling group) | GEN (Generator) | 
| The physics subgroup investigating the Higgs decaying into two photons | HGam | Hgg |
| The central software used by the above subgroup. | HGamCore | flashgg |
| The webpage meant to track the history and progress of a physics analysis | GLANCE | CADI | 
| The group which optimizes the tagging and calibration performance for different types of physics objects. | CP group (Combined performance group) | POG (Physics object group) | 
| A small committee which reviews a physics analysis. | EB (Editorial board) | ARC (Analysis review committee) | 
| The central software repository used to simulate the detector and its reconstruction algorithms. This software is crucial for processing data and simulation the same way for eventualy comparison. | Athena | CMSSW | 
| The inital setup command for using the central detector software. | `setupATLAS` | `cmsenv` |
| The subdetector responsible for measuring the luminosity delivered to the detector. | LUCID | BRIL | 
| The run coordination shifter who oversees the daily run operations. | Run Manager | Run Field Manager |

ATLAS and CMS are both very cool physics collaborations based at the CERN LHC. Their organizations are structurally similar, leading to similar groups and positions but with somewhat different names. The purpose of the table below is to translate the same type of group/position between the two collaborations. <br> <br>

| Description | ATLAS | CMS | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| The group facilitating a certain physics topic| PA group | PAG | 
| The webpage meant to track the history and progress of a physics analysis | GLANCE | CADI | 
| The group which optimizes the tagging and calibration performance for different types of physics objects. | CP group (Combined performance group) | POG (Physics object group) | 
| A small committee which reviews a physics analysis. | EB (Editorial board) | ARC (Analysis review committee) | 
| The central software repository used to simulate the detector and its reconstruction algorithms. This software is crucial for processing data and simulation the same way for eventualy comparison. | Athena | CMSSW | 
| The inital setup command for using a the central detector software. | `setupATLAS` | `cmsenv` |
| The run coordination shifter who oversees the daily run operations. | Run Manager | Run Field Manager |

Hello! My name is Abraham (Abe) Tishelman-Charny, and I am interested in physics, collaboration, and programming. I am currently finishing my PhD in experimental particle physics with Northeastern University, during which I have been based at CERN working as a part of the CMS collaboration. I will soon be starting a postdoctoral position at Brookhaven National Laboratory, to work as a part of the ATLAS collaboration. The purpose of this page is to store and share material related to my research.
